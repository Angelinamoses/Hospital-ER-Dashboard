# 🏥 Emergency Room Performance Dashboard  
**Power BI | Healthcare Analytics | Data Visualization**

This project analyzes Emergency Room (ER) performance using real hospital workflow data.  
The goal is to understand patient flow, identify bottlenecks, and highlight operational patterns that affect patient experience and clinical efficiency.

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
Emergency departments run under constant pressure. This dashboard brings clarity by visualizing:  
- Patient volume trends  
- Triage category distribution  
- Waiting time patterns  
- Admission vs. discharge ratios  
- Hourly and daily workload fluctuations  

The dashboard helps clinicians and admins make faster, data-driven decisions that improve overall care quality.

## 🧠 Key Insights  
- Peak ER traffic hours and days  
- Which triage categories consume the most resources  
- Patterns in patient waiting times  
- Efficiency gaps where performance drops  
- How patient load changes over time  

These insights support decisions around staffing, workflow optimization, and resource allocation.
